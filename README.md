# This is the frontend part of the project.

The frontend part of the solution is not deployed yet. so you can run it locally using `npm start` command.

## The front-end part consists of 
React.JS, Bootstrap, Material-UI ,Font Awesome Libraries.
I have used several types of hooks context API for state management. I have used libraries like "bcrypt" for authentication.

## For styling,
I have used from ordinary CSS to Bootstrap with utility classes and Material-UI components to achieve responsiveness and ease of building.

## Connection with OMDB API 

The front-end is connected with OMDB API using `get` requests and also connected with my node js service with `get` and `post` requests.

## usage 

after running `npm start` you can use a demo email - `robel.asmamaw@gmail.com` and password `12345` 
you can also create your account and start navigating through the app.
